"Made in NYC" logo [lovingly made in NYC](http://www.pediacities.com/2012/12/proudly-made-in-nyc/) ;)


####Note:  
To edit the file in Illustrator or Inkscape, be sure to [install the free Silkscreen font first]((http://www.kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen/).
If you'd rather not install the font, use the vector files with the"-nofont" suffix.
